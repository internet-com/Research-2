The cosmos hub is a proof of stake base block chain, which is secured by a set of cosmos validate. as in cosmos block chains are called zones and 
zones are pegged you a custodial block chain called a hub.
the founding hub and the cosmos network will be secured by ATOM holders. 
cosmos is the first network pioneering interoperability among solid block chains through a packet transfer protocol called IBC, 
more dynamic than atomic swaps i b c or into block chain communication facilitate secure transfer of both fungible and non fungible crypto assets across block chains within the cosmos network, cosmos validate as secure the cosmos huh by staking adams, you can think of atoms as virtual eyes hey six, validate as are like mining pools and delegate as are adam holders who bond their atoms to cosmos validates, no matter how many atoms you own you can delegate your atoms to the validate as and earn a portion of block rewards, when a block is created black rewards are distributed to the validate as an delegate as at the same time, cosmos validate as are rewarded in both adams and photons, uh, the top one hundred candidates with the most atoms bonded to them will become validate as, validate as can set a commission that delegate as pay for the invaluable services that they provide, would you jump, to learn more about atoms and photons or how to become a valid a to join in the valley data working group, become a cosmos validator.
Cosmos枢纽是一个基于权益证明的区块链，其安全性由Cosmos的验证人节点保证。

在Comos中，区块链称为区域，并且区域被固定为一个称为枢纽的保管区块链，创立中心和宇宙网络将由亚洲拥有者保护，宇宙是第一个通过称为ibc的分组传输协议在固体块链之间开创互操作性的网络，比原子交换ibc更具动态性，或者通过块链通信促进块链之间的可互换和非互换密码资产的安全传输在宇宙网络中，宇宙通过放样亚当斯证明宇宙是安全的，你可以将原子想象为虚拟的眼睛嘿六，验证就像采矿池和代表一样，不管如何将原子与宇宙联系起来你拥有的许多原子可以将你的原子委托给验证并获得一部分块奖励，当创建块时，黑色奖励将分配给valida作为一个代表同时，宇宙验证是在亚当斯和光子，呃奖励，前100名候选人与最多的原子绑定到他们将成为验证，验证可以设置佣金，委托作为支付对于他们提供的宝贵服务，您是否会跳起来，了解更多关于原子和光子的知识，或者如何成为加入谷数据工作组的有效人选，成为一名宇宙验证者。
