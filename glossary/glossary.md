|Blockchain Basics||
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Address                | A bitcoin address looks like 1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV. It consists of a string of letters and numbers. It’s really an encoded base58check version of a public key 160-bit hash. Just like you ask others to send an email to your email address, you would ask others to send you bitcoin to one of your bitcoin addresses. |
| BIP                    | Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. A set of proposals that members of the bitcoin community have submitted to improve bitcoin. For example, BIP-21 is a pro‐ posal to improve the bitcoin uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme. |
| Bitcoin                | The name of the currency unit (the coin), the network, and the software. |
| Block                  | A grouping of transactions, marked with a timestamp, and a fingerprint of the previous block. The block header is hashed to produce a proof of work, thereby validating the transactions. Valid blocks are added to the main blockchain by net‐ work consensus. |
| BTC                    | An abbreviation for the bitcoin currency.                    |
| coinbase               | A special field used as the sole input for coinbase transactions. The coinbase allows claiming the block reward and provides up to 100 bytes for arbitrary data. Not to be confused with Coinbase transaction. |
| Centralized            | Organized such that one or more parties are in control of a service. |
| coinbase transaction   | The first transaction in a block. Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase. Not to be confused with Coinbase. |
| cold storage           | Refers to keeping a reserve of bitcoin offline. Cold storage is achieved when Bit‐ coin private keys are created and stored in a secure offline environment. Cold storage is important for anyone with bitcoin holdings. Online computers are vul‐ nerable to hackers and should not be used to store a significant amount of bit‐ coin. |
| Confirmation           | Once a transaction is included in a block, it has one confirmation. As soon as another block is mined on the same blockchain, the transaction has two confir‐ mations, and so on. Six or more confirmations is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed. |
| consensus              | When several nodes, usually most nodes on the network, all have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain. Not to be confused with consensus rules. |
| Cryptocurrency         | A type of currency that uses cryptography instead of a central bank to provide security and verify transactions. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. |
| Decentralized          | Without a central authority or controlling party. Bitcoin is a decentralized network since no company, government, or individual is in control of it. |
| Distributed            | A distributed network is designed so that there is no central server or entity that others must connect to. Instead, network participants connect directly to each other. Bitcoin is a distributed network. |
| Encryption             | The use of cryptography to encode a message such that only the intended recipient(s) can decode it. Bitcoin uses encryption to protect wallets from unauthorized access. |
| Hash                   | A digital fingerprint of some binary input.                  |
| Ledger                 | A physical or electronic log book containing a list of transactions and balances typically involving financial accounts. The Bitcoin blockchain is the first distributed, decentralized, public ledger. |
| Miner                  | A computer or group of computers that add new transactions to blocks and verify blocks created by other miners. Miners collect transaction fees and are rewarded with new bitcoins for their services. |
| Node                   | A participant in the Bitcoin network. Nodes share a copy of the blockchain and relay new transactions to other nodes. |
| Private Key            | A string of letters and numbers that can be used to spend bitcoins associated with a specific Bitcoin address. |
| Public Key             | A string of letters and numbers that is derived from a private key. A public key allows one to receive bitcoins. |
| Protocol               | The official rules that dictate how participants on a network must communicate. Bitcoin's protocol specifies how each node connects with the others, how many bitcoins will exist at any point in time, and defines other aspects of the network. |
| Signature              | A portion of a Bitcoin transaction that proves that the owner of the private key has approved the transaction. |
| Transaction            | In simple terms, a transfer of bitcoin from one address to another. More pre‐ cisely, a transaction is a signed data structure expressing a transfer of value. Transactions are transmitted over the bitcoin network, collected by miners, and included into blocks, made permanent on the blockchain. |
| probabilistic finality | a proof of work blockchain never allows a transaction to truly be “finalized”; for any given block, there is always the possibility that someone will create a longer chain that starts from a block before that block and does not include that block. |
| exchange               | An exchange is a marketplace in which cryptocurencies are traded. |
